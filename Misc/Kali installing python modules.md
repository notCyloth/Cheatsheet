# P A I N
Kali is annoying for installing modules on system. Try making a venv and installing through there.
## Making a venv
```bash
python3 -m venv env_dir .
```
```bash
cd env_dir
```
```bash
source bin/activate
```
```bash
pip3 install [MODULE]
```
From inside this venv, run exploits till your hearts content! Remember to deactivate when done!
```bash
deactivate
```
