# Enumeration
For this to work, exact details about which OS, kernel version and system architecture is used is crucial.
```bash
cat /etc/issue
```
```bash
uname -r
```
```bash
arch
```
## Finding kernel exploits
```bash
searchsploit "linux kernel $(OS) $(General_Version) Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "4." | grep -v " < $(Exact_Version_Number)" | grep -v "$(Higher_Version)"
```
For example, the below would find Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (kernel 4.4.0-116-generic):
```bash
searchsploit "linux kernel Ubuntu 16 Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "4." | grep -v " < 4.4.0" | grep -v "4.8"
```
